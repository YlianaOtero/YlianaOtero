Hi there! I'm a Software Engineer at Cencosud, contributing to the Platform Engineering team.

Currently pursuing a degree in Software/Systems Engineering at Universidad ORT Uruguay, I’m combining academic learning with real-world application. My professional and academic journey has equipped me with skills in:

- Cloud Platforms: Designing and deploying scalable, high-availability solutions.
- Kubernetes and DevOps: Automating deployments and infrastructure-as-code.
- Programming: Experience in Go, C# (.NET), Python and other modern languages for creating reliable and maintainable systems.
- Collaboration: Thriving in multidisciplinary teams to deliver impactful projects.

I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and am always eager to learn and grow. Whether it’s optimizing processes, exploring emerging technologies, or mastering new frameworks, I aim to deliver meaningful results with curiosity and dedication.

Outside of work, I prioritize maintaining balance while continuously pursuing personal and professional growth.
