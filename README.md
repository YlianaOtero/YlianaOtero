### Hi there 👋

My name is Yliana.
I am a 21 years old software engineering student from Montevideo, Uruguay. 

I am a fan of science, technology and literature, and a Cloud enthusiast. 

I have a passion for cloud architecture, devops and software development. 

Currently, I have three Google Cloud Professional Certifications and over 50 online courses about data, AI, DevOps, cloud computing, and more. 

As a very curious person, the IT world fascinates me, and I wish to keep learning and growing from it!

I work as a DevOps Engineer at Perceptiva, where I do stuff like:

• Implementation, deployment, and maintenance of systems.

• Cloud infrastructure management and systems administration.

• Infrastructure as code.

• Monitoring and troubleshooting.

Key technologies: Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, Git, Helm, Google Cloud Platform, MySQL, Cassandra, Axway.
